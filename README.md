# test-md

Test markdown the language



# Goal

Take test automation from the programmers and give it to the testers.

You shouldn't need to be a programmer to do test automation.  You shouldn't need to specify a automated test case in a 
programming language.



simple as it can be but no simpler

needs to be able to be read like words in a novel
